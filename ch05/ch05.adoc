=== 5.8 Chapter Exercises
==== Multiple choice
. c) value of type `*[a]*` is a list whose elements are all of some type `*a*`
. a) function of type `*\[[a]] -> [a]*` could take a list of strings as an argument
. b) function of type `*[a] -> Int -> a*` returns one element of type `a` from a list
. c) function of type `*(a, b) -> a*` takes a tuple argument and returns the first value

==== Determine the type
. return value and type
.. `54 :: Num a => a`
.. `(0, "doge) :: Num t => (t, [Char])`
.. `(0, "doge) :: (Integer, [Char])`
.. `False :: Bool`
.. `5 :: Int`
.. `False :: Bool`
. type is `Num a => a`
. `y` is shadowed, type is `Num a => a -> a`
. type is `Fractional => a :: a`
. type is `[Char]`

==== Does it compile?
. `wahoo = bigNum $ 10` breaks, because `bigNum` is a value, not a function
. works fine; is an example of partial application.
. breaks on `c = b 10`, `b` has value `5`, cannot apply value to a value
. breaks on `b = 10000 * c`, `c` is not defined

==== Type variable or specific type constructor?
. `f :: zed -> Zed -> Blah` is fully polymorphic, concrete and concrete
. `f :: Enum b => a -> b -> C` is fully polymorphic, constrained polymorphic and concrete
. `f :: f -> g -> C` is fully polymorphic, fully polymorphic and concrete

==== Write a type signature
. `functionH (x:_) = x` type signature `functionH :: [a] -> a`
. `functionC x y = if (x > y) then True else False` type signature `functionC :: Ord a => a -> a -> Bool`
. `functionS (x, y) = y` type signature `functionS :: (a, b) -> b`

==== Given a type, write the function
. `i :: a -> a; i a = a` or `id`
. `c :: a -> b -> a; c a _ = a`
. `c'' :: b -> a -> b; c :: a -> b -> a` they are the same
. `c' :: a -> b -> b; c _ b = b`
. `r :: [a] -> [a]` possibly `r a = tail a` or `r a = reverse a`
. `co :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c); co = (.)`
. `a :: (a -> c) -> a -> a; a f x = x` basically ignore the first argument
. `a' :: (a -> b) -> a -> b; a' = ($)`
